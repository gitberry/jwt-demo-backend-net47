following along from here:
https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/asp-net-web-api-2-creating-and-validating-jwt-json-web-token/


Create an ASP.NET Web API application in Visual Studio 2019:
File -> New Project -> ASP.NET Web Application -> Web API 
(without  authentication to keep things simple).
(I also deslected HTTPS)

The above example compiled but when I rand it it bjorked because the key was too short - so I doubled it - and 
it generated a token OK - of course can't consume it directly on browser but I got this:

eyJqdGkiOiI3OTRkOWQ3MS0xMTAyLTRiMDAtYWI0NC0yNTY0NWYyZmNlN2EiLCJ2YWxpZCI6IjEiLCJ1c2VyaWQiOiIxIiwibmFtZSI6ImJpbGFsIiwiZXhwIjoxNzA0ODE2NTAzLCJpc3MiOiJodHRwOi8vbXlzaXRlLmNvbSIsImF1ZCI6Imh0dHA6Ly9teXNpdGUuY29tIn0

(of course it will be different each run but anyway )

went to here: https://jwt.io/

and with my secret (below) - it validated...

The initial example did not seem to be validating the auth tokens - 
which I confirmed are indeed in the header... SO...  googling gave
me some good advice here:
https://decatechlabs.com/secure-webapi-using-jwt

and now it does.  

The rest is testing and tweaking to get the behavior exactly as desired.
